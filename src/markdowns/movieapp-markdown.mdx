## MovieApp

   This application is a web-based simulation of the popular movie database website IMDb. We developed this one to improve our skills in React 18, HTTP requests and tailwind, and also to put in our portfolio! We are passionate about movies and like a lot to use IMDb to search for some movies, so we think it could be nice to built our own movie database with our styles tastes.
